# belly-button-analysis

## Overview

This project was designed to organize and visualize the data collected from the belly button sample analysis. By creating a dashboard we are allowing the analysis participants the chance to see the data that was extracted from their respective samples.

Participants will be able to find their sample number and the data associated with their sample. This data will be presented in the form of a bar chart that describes the bacteria that were most present in their belly buttons, a guage chart showing the amount of times their belly buttons were scrubbed and cleaned during a week, and a bubble chart visualizing the commanility of the cultures that were present in their belly buttons.
